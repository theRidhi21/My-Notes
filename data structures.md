## Data Structures :
It is the organising and storing the data in sequential order so that it can be used efficiently(Time complexity and space complexity).

#### Time and space complexity : It is measurement of "how much time or space" occupied by an algorithm.
###### Time Complexity : 
It is very important when consider large or huge data.
Lower the complexity more efficient is the code
It is usually measured by "BIG O".
i.e, O(1),O(n),O(n^2),etc...
For example : Linear search - O(n)
Binary search - O(logn)
#### *O(n) increases linearly , it is faster than O(n^2), slower than O(logn),very much lower than O(2^n)[exponential growth].

###### Space Complexity : 
It is very important when consider large or huge data.
Lower the complexity more efficient is the code

##### Classification ->
1. Primitive DS ---- Arrays,Pointers,int,char,double,float,complex
2. Non-Primitive DS  ----  Linear,Non-linear

Linear DS : Stacks,Queues,Linked list etc...
Non-Lonear DS : Trees and Graphs.

##### Operations in DS : 
 1. Initialisation : Initialising some values.
 2. Insertion :  Inserting some values.
 3. Deletion : Deleting some values.
 4. Searching : Searchimg for a particular element or value.
 5. Traversing : Going through each element from first to last.
 6. Sorting : Sorting the values in required order.
