## Data Structures :
It is the organising and storing the data in sequential order so that it can be used efficiently(Time complexity and space complexity).

#### Time and space complexity :
It is usually measured by "BIG O".
i.e, O(1),O(n),O(n^2),etc...

##### Classification ->
1. linear ---- Arrays,Pointers,int,char,double,float,complex
2. Non-linear ----
